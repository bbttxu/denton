              %h4 What is this site about?
              %p I created this site because I wanted a single, easy-to-use website where I could find out what is going on in this town.
              %p This site scrapes info off of publicly available websites and consolidates, or "mashes up", that info into one place. I also wanted to make the site interesting to look at, though really, I'm no designer.

            %li
              %h4 Why is my venue not here?
              %p There may be a couple reasons
              %ol
                %li I don't know about your venue
                %li Your calendar is not public, or you don't have one
                %li Or, a combination of the two

            %li
              %h4 What can I do about that?
              %p Two things
              %ol
                %li Let me know where I can find the information and I'll add the venue in my free time, which is when I work on this site
                %li Or, download a copy of the code and let me know when you've added the appropriate scripts to scrape the data.
